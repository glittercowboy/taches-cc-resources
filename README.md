# TÂCHES Prompts

A collection of my favorite Claude Code prompts and prompt systems.

## Available Prompts

### [Meta-Prompting](./meta-prompting/)

A systematic approach to building complex software by delegating prompt engineering to Claude itself. Instead of telling Claude what to do, you tell Claude what you want, and it figures out how to ask itself to do it.

Perfect for complex refactoring, new features, and multi-step tasks where you want rigorous specifications without manually crafting detailed prompts.

### [Interactive Forms](./interactive-forms/)

Structured questionnaires with visual tab navigation that guide you through complex requirement gathering. Generate ASCII-based forms that break down decisions into clear, manageable sections.

Perfect for configurations, project initialization, and feature planning where you need to consider multiple options and their implications. Works seamlessly with meta-prompting for end-to-end workflows.
